# Espruimulator README

Paths in this README are from /emulator

This folder contains helper scripts and stubs for running a local Node-based emulator/smoke-runner for the app.

Files:

- run_emulator.js : Node script that stubs Bangle/g APIs and runs the app code for quick testing all in the terminal
- run_emulator_ui.js: Node script that stubs Bangle/g APIs, starts a local server, and emulates the environment in your browser at localhost://3000
- storage_stub.js : Simple Storage shim used by the Node runner.

Folders:

- /ui: Contains client.js and index.html to generate the canvas for the emulator display in the browser along with a simple log that right now just gives you what button is being pressed.

- /tmp_emu_storage: Contains pokewalker.json that holds the app state generated by the emulator

- /logs: Should contain server log and PID files for the emulator

Notes:

- These are developer tools only and are not used on the device.
- You can modify or expand the stubs to emulate BLE, input events, or different hardware behaviors.
